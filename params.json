{"name":"Luciphor","tagline":"","body":"\r\nLuciPHOr\r\n========\r\nLuciphor is a program that performs phospho-site localization on MS/MS data processed by the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP). It is unique in that it is the first phospho-site prediction program to provide estimates for the false localization rate (FLR). \r\n\r\nLuciphor takes in as input PeptideProphet XML files and spectral files (mzXML, mzML). From these it predicts the correct phosopho-peptide permutation for the peptide sequences reported in the XML files. \r\n\r\nLuciphor is written in C++ and uses the Boost and ProteoWizard libraries for reading mz*ML files. Instructions for compiling Luciphor locally on your computer are provided in the build_luciphor.html file. This software is designed to be compiled and executed on Linux. All testing has been performed on RHEL 6.3 (64-bit), GCC compiler version 4.4.6 20120305.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 Damian Fermin\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
