luciphor
========
Luciphor is a program that performs phospho-site localization on MS/MS data processed by the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP).

Luciphor takes in as input PeptideProphet XML files and spectral files (mzXML, mzML). From these it predicts the correct phosopho-peptide permutation for the peptide sequences reported in the XML files.
